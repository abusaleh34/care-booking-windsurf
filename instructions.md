## 1  Explicit Functional Requirements

The platform must enable customers, service providers, and administrators to perform these core tasks:

* **Account and identity management** – registration via e-mail, phone, or social identity; one-time-code verification; secure sign-in/out; password reset; Arabic and English interfaces.
* **Service & product discovery** – search and filter by category, location, price, rating, and availability; sort by relevance or distance.
* **Booking & scheduling** – select real-time availability, confirm, reschedule, or cancel within policy rules; automated reminders (e-mail, SMS, or web push).
* **Checkout & payments** – unified cart for services and products, coupon support, secure payment flow, automatic commission deduction, downloadable invoice.
* **Ratings & reviews** – star ratings, text feedback, optional image uploads; provider replies; moderation workflow.
* **Real-time communication** – browser-based live chat between customer and provider plus ticket-based support.
* **Provider workspace** – manage profile, catalogue, calendar, discounts, earnings dashboard, and payout requests.
* **Administration console** – oversee users, providers, categories, bookings, payments, disputes, static pages, notifications, reports, and role-based sub-admins.

## 2  Implicit (Inferred) Functional Requirements

* Role-based access control for customer, provider, support, finance, and super-admin roles.
* Session handling with optional “remember me” across browsers.
* Automated fraud and policy checks on price or content changes.
* Configurable commission rules per service category.
* Complete audit logging for disputes and compliance.
* Right-to-left layout support and localized date, currency, and numeral formats.
* Data-retention and deletion workflows aligned with Saudi data-protection law.

## 3  Technical Requirements

### 3.1  System Architecture

* Three-layer structure

  * **Presentation layer** – responsive web application served to all device sizes.
  * **Application layer** – stateless web services that implement business logic and integrations.
  * **Data layer** – structured data store, cache/queue layer, and object storage for binary assets.
* Deployable on-premises or in the cloud; horizontally scalable behind load balancers.

### 3.2  Technology Stack (discipline-level)

* **Frontend** – modern web framework supporting component reuse, internationalization, and web push notifications.
* **Backend** – contemporary server-side framework capable of REST and/or GraphQL APIs.
* **Data services** – relational database for transactions; in-memory store for caching and queues; distributed file store for media.
* **Realtime services** – publish/subscribe or WebSocket infrastructure for chat and live updates.

### 3.3  Infrastructure Components

* Stateless application containers or virtual machines.
* Highly available database cluster with automated backups.
* Scalable object storage with lifecycle rules for large files.
* Content-delivery capability for static assets and media.
* Centralized logging, metrics, and alerting.

### 3.4  Integration Requirements

* Multiple payment providers supporting local cards, e-wallets, and bank transfers.
* One-time-password SMS or e-mail gateways.
* Mapping and geolocation services for distance calculations and address selection.
* Social-identity providers for single-click sign-up and sign-in.
* Browser-based live-chat service or in-house realtime messaging.

### 3.5  Data Storage & Management

* Normalized schemas for users, providers, bookings, payments, products, reviews, and logs.
* Media assets (images, invoices, attachments) stored outside the relational database.
* Encryption at rest and in transit; scheduled encrypted backups with retention policies.

### 3.6  Security, Privacy & Compliance

* Enforced secure-channel communication (current TLS) for all traffic.
* Token-based authentication with refresh capability.
* Alignment with payment-industry standards (card data tokenised by gateway).
* Compliance with Saudi Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) for consent, residency, and deletion.
* Web-application firewall, rate limiting, vulnerability scanning, least-privilege access controls.

### 3.7  DevOps & Quality Assurance

* Version-controlled source with feature-branch workflow.
* Continuous integration running unit, integration, and end-to-end browser tests.
* Automated builds deployed to identical staging and production environments, enabling safe blue-green or rolling releases.
* Defined post-launch support period for bug fixes and critical updates.
